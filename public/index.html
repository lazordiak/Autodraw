  <p>Why draw with your hands? Now, you DON'T HAVE TO. This little brush will draw according to where you direct it. The brush will record your voice commands, just tell it what to do!</p>
  <p>Set the direction with "left", "right", "up", or "down". "Yes" will move the pointer in the given direction, "no" will stop the pointer moving. "Go" will start painting, and "stop" will stop.</p>
  <p>"One" through "nine" will change your brush size.
